## MR Intro
<<<<<<< HEAD
<br>
First Hololens development with Unity. Sets up camera and builds project with HoloLens specs. Basic overview of
how development in HoloLens works
<br>

## HoloLens Dev 101
<br>
Introduction project (should be deleted honestly) that walked through spatial mapping and understanding as well 
placing objects in the real world.
<br>

## HoloLens Sandbox
<br>
Experimental development project

ballSpanwer scene spawns balls based of inputClick with a cursor on either the ground or front wall. 
(NOTE: cursor must be on an object to execute onInputClicked()). Clicking on a specific ball destroys 
that instance.

NodeViewer connects multiple nodes using the drawCylinder.cs from (Nodes project by James Lynch)[https://github.com/chrisdarcy96/Summer_2018/tree/master/Nodes]
. Upon gaze, executes a script that displays miniNodes and text.
<br>

## Nodes
<br>
Projected created by James Lynch. Attaches cylinder connecters between nodes in a graph that dynamically adjust 
size/rotation at runtime.
